        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Wheat (Triticum spp.) is world’s most widely cultivated food crops. It is
            mainly a rabi season crop in India. It has played a very vital role in
            stabilizing the food grain production in the country over the past few years.
            In India , it is the second important staple cereal food.<br><br>
            The origin of the durum wheats was probably in the region of Abyssinia,
             whereas the whole group of soft wheat, which includes the bread wheats,
              probably originated in the region of Pakistan, SouthWestern and the Southern parts of mountainous Bokhara.

        <h3>Climate and Soil:</h3>
        <p>The ideal temperature requirement varies from plant type and stages of growth.
             The dwarf varieties require the following temperature for their growth and development:</p>

             </table>
             <p>Wheat plants are sensitive to very cold or frost injury at any stage of growth particularly 
                at reproductive growth if temperature is below 150</p> <hr>
            <h3>Land Preparation</h3>
            <p>The wheat crop requires a well-pulverized but compact seed bed for good and uniform germination. 
                Three or four ploughings in the summer, repeated harrowing in the rainy season, 
                followed by three or four cultivations and planking immediately before sowing produce a good,
                 firm seed bed for the dry crop on alluvial soils. For the irrigated crop, 
                 the land is given a pre-sowing irrigation (palewa or raund) and the number of ploughings is reduced. 
                 Where white ants or other pests are a problem, Aldrin 5% or BHC 10% dust at the rate of 25 kg/ha should 
                 be applied to the soil after the last ploughing or before planking.</p><hr>
            <h3> Sowing : </h3>
            <h4>a) Sowing time:</h4>
            <p>Based on above temperature requirement it has been found that for indigenous wheat last week of October, 
                for long duration dwarf varieties like Kalyansona, Arjun, etc. first fortnight of November and for short 
                duration dwarf wheats like Sonalika, Raj 821 etc. second fortnight is the best sowing time. Under exceptionally
                late sown condition it may be delayed to latest by 1st week of December beyond which if area is very small transplanting may be practiced.
            </p>
            <h4>b) Seed rate:</h4>
            <p>Generally, a seed rate of 100 kg/ha has been found to be sufficient for most of the varieties like Kalyan Sona, Arjun,
                 Janak, etc.which have moderate tillering and medium sized grains. But a higher seed rate of 125 kg/ha is desirable 
                 for late sown wheat and normal sown for varieties like Sonalika, Raj 821 etc. which have bold grains and shy tillering habits.</p>
                 <h4>c) Spacing: :</h4>
                 <p>For irrigated, timely sown wheat, a row spacing of 15 to 22.5 cm is followed, but 22.5 cm between the rows is considered to be 
                    the optimum spacing. Under irrigated late-sown conditions, a row spacing of 15-18 cm is the optimum. For dwarf wheats, the planting 
                    depth should be between 5 and 6 cm. Planting beyond this depth results in a poor stand. In the case of conventional tall varieties, 
                    the depth of sowing may be 8 or 9 cm.
                </p>
                <h4>d) Seed treatment:</h4>
                <p>The seed of loose smut-susceptible varieties should be given solar or hot-water treatment. If the wheat seed is used only for sowing,
                     and not for human consumption or for feeding cattle, it can be treated with Vitavax.</p><hr>
                    <h3>Application of Mannures and Fertilizer</h3>
                    <p>It is desirable that 2 to 3 tonnes of farmyard manure per hectare or some other organic matter is applied 5 or 6 weeks before sowing.
                         The fertilizer requirement of the irrigated wheat crop are as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. With assured fertilizer supply: <br>
                            Nitrogen (N) @8- - 120 kg/ha <br>
                            Phosphorus (P2O5) @ 40- 60 kg/ha <br>
                            Potash (K2O) @ 40 kg/ha.</p>
                        <p>B. Under fertilizer constraints:<br>
                            N @ 60-80 kg/ha<br>
                            P2O5 @ 30-40 kg/ha<br>
                            K2O @ 20-25 kg/ha.<br>
                        </p>
                    <p>Total quantity of Phosphorus and potash and half the quantity of nitrogen should be applied at the time of sowing. 
                        Remaining quantity of Nitrogen should be applied at the time of crown root initiation.For the late sown irrigated wheat crop,
                         the NPK fertilizer dose recommended is: <br>
                        N – 60-80 kg/ha <br>
                        P2O5 – 30-40 kg/ha <br>
                        K2O – 20-25 kg/ha.</p> <hr>
                    <h3>Interculture:</h3>
                    <p>Generally weeding is done after 1 ½ to 2 months after sowing or weedicides like 2,4 D, Avadex or Nitrofen (Tok E-25) for controling Chenopodium sp,
                         Angallis sp. Asphodelus sp. Phalaris sp. of weeds.</p> <hr>
                    <h3>Irrigation:</h3>
                    <p>The high yielding wheat varieties should be given five to six irrigations at their critical growth stages viz. Crown root initiation, tillering, jointing,
                         flowering, milk and dough which come at 21-25 days after sowing (DAS), 45-60 DAS, 60-70 DAS, 90-95 DAS, 100-105 DAS and 120-125 DAS respectively. Off these 
                         irrigation at CRI stage is most important.</p> <hr>

                <h3>Harvesting and Storage:</h3>
                <h4>a) Harvesting:</h4>
                <p>The rain-fed crop reaches the harvest stage much earlier than the irrigated crop. 
                    The crop is harvested when the grains become hard and the straw becomes dry and brittle.
                    The harvesting is mostly done by sickle. The crop is threshed by treading with cattle on the threshing-flour
                     or by power driven thresher.</p>
                <h4>b) Yield:</h4>
                <p>The national average yield of wheat grain is about 12 to 13.8 quintals per hectare.</p>
                <h4>c) Storage:</h4>
                <p>The grains should be thoroughly dried before storage. The storage life of the grain is closely 
                    related to its moisture content. Grains with less than 10 percent moisture store well. 
                    The storage pits, bins or godowns should be moisture-proof and should be fumigated to keep down the stored 
                     grain pests including rats. Zinc phosphide is very effective against rats.
