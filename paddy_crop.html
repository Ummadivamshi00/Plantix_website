            <h3>Information on Paddy Crop</h3>
            <p>Rice is the seed of a grass variety called Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima. 
                Paddy plant has a fibrous root with the plant growing upto 6 feet tall. 
                It has a round jointed stem with leaves being long and pointed. 
                The edible seeds which are sold commercially as ‘rice’ grow on the top 
                in the form of separate stalks. Technically this is called paddy as the
                 seeds are covered with a brown colored husk. The paddy is then harvested and dehusked
                  resulting in the commercially important rice. Often people confuse rice and paddy.
                   Rice fields are also called as paddy fields.</p> <hr>
            <h3>Climate for Paddy Cultivation</h3>
            <p>Rice is a tropical climate crop that can grow from sea level to an altitude of 3000 meters.
                 Paddy cultivation can also be done in temperate and sub-tropical climate under humid conditions.
                  A high temperature, humidity and sufficient rainfall with irrigation facilities are the primary
                   requirements of paddy cultivation. It also needs bright sunshine with temperature ranging between 
                   20 and 40⁰C. It can tolerate temperature upto 42⁰C.</p> <hr>
                <h3>Season for Rice Crop</h3>
                <p>Since rice can grow in a variety of climate and altitude it is cultivated in different seasons 
                    in different parts of the country. In areas of high rainfall and low winter temperature 
                    (northern and western parts) rice crop is grown once a year- during May to November.
                     Two or three crops are grown in the southern and eastern states. India has three rice
                      farming seasons- summer, autumn and winter. However, the chief rice growing season is
                       ‘kharif’ season also called ‘winter rice’. The sowing time is June-July and is harvested 
                       during November- December months. 84% of the country’s rice supply is grown in the kharif crop.</p><br>
                       <p>Rice cultivated during rabi season is also called as ‘summer rice’. It is sown in the months 
                        of November to February and harvested during March to June. 9% of total rice crop is grown in this
                         season. Early maturing varieties are normally grown during this time.</p><br>
                         <p>The pre-kharif or ‘autumn rice’ is sown during May to August. The sowing time also depends on 
                            the rainfall and weather condition. Hence the timing may differ slightly from place to place.
                             Generally, it is harvested during September- October months. 7% of the total rice crop in India 
                             grows in this season and short duration varieties which mature within 90-110 days are cultivated.</p> <hr>
                             <h3>Soil for Rice Cultivation</h3>
                            <p>Almost every type of soil can be used for rice cultivation provided the region has a high level of humidity,
                                 sufficient rainfall with irrigational facilities, and a high temperature. The major types of soils for rice 
                                 cultivation are black soil, red soil (loamy and yellow), laterite soil, red sandy, terai, hill and medium 
                                 to shallow black soil. It can be even cultivated on silts and gravels. If the cultivating soil has rich organic
                                  matter and if it powders easily on drying or forms a puddle when wet then it is considered to be ideal.</p>
                                <hr><h3>Water</h3>
                                <p>Bund farming system is followed in case of rice cultivation wherein the fields are flooded continuously
                                     upto 7-10 days before harvesting. To produce a kilogram of rice the crop on an average needs about 1500
                                      liters of water. In other words, rice needs a huge amount of water for cultivation. This continuous flooding 
                                      practice is followed to ensure weed control and sufficient water supply. Flooded soil also ensures:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Better nutrient availability</li>
                                        <li>Moisture stress elimination</li>
                                        <li>Micro-climate for favorable crop production</li>
                                    </ul><hr>
                                    <h3>Crop Rotation with Rice Crop</h3>
                                    <p>Legumes are the most commonly used crops used for crop rotation with rice.
                                         This is especially in case of places with lower water supply. 
                                         Rice in such places is cultivated only once a year and the rest
                                          of the year the land is fallow. Hence planting legumes in such period
                                           would optimize land use and also help increase fertility of soil.
                                    </p> <hr>
            <h3>Planting Material</h3>
            <p>Rice is propagated from paddy seeds. Therefore, seed selection plays a critical role in the yield. 
                Some points that must be noted for selecting best quality seeds are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Seeds must be fully-developed and mature</li>
                <li>Clean paddy seeds</li>
                <li>No signs of aging</li>
                <li>High capacity of germination</li>
            </ul><hr>
            <h3>Land Preparation for Paddy Cultivation</h3>
            <p>Rice is cultivated in different methods depending on the water availability and weather. 
                In areas where the rainfall is abundant clubbed with abundant water supply, wet system of 
                cultivation is followed. On the other hand, in areas where irrigation facilities are unavailable and water is scarce, 
                dry cultivation system is followed.</p><hr>
            <h3>Wet Cultivation System</h3>
            <p>The land is thoroughly ploughed and flooded with water upto 5cm in depth.
                 In case of clayey or loamy soil the depth must be 10 cm. Post puddling 
                 the land is levelled so as to ensure uniform water distribution. Seedlings
                  are sown or transplanted after leveling.</p><hr>
            <h3>Dry Cultivation System</h3>
            <p>In this rice cultivation process the soil must have a good tilth hence it must 
                be ploughed thoroughly. In addition, farm yard manure must be distributed on the
                 field uniformly at least 4 weeks before sowing. The seeds are then sown with 30 
                 cm spacing between the plants.</p><hr>
                <h3>Rice Cultivation Method</h3>
            <p>Most farmers practice nursery bed method. Nursery beds are made occupying about 1/20th of the total field area.
                 The paddy seeds are sown in the bed. They are ready within 25 days of sowing in low land areas while in higher 
                 altitudes they take about 55 days to become ready for transplantation. There are four different practices of cultivation 
                 of rice, viz. transplantation method, drilling method, broadcast method and Japanese method.</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><b>Transplantation </b>is the most commonly used method wherein seeds are first sown in nursery and the seedlings
                         are transplanted to the main field once they show 3-4 leaves. Although this is the best yielding method, 
                         it requires heavy labor.</li>
                    <li><b>Drilling </b> method is exclusive to India. In this method, one person ploughs a hole in the land and the 
                        other person sows the seed. Ox is the most commonly used ‘person’ to plough the land.</li>
                    <li><b>Broadcast </b>method generally involves scattering of the seeds manually over a large area or in the entire 
                        field. Labor involved is very less and so is the precision. This method produces very less yield as compared to others.</li>
                    <li><b>Japanese method </b> has been adopted for the high yielding variety of rice and those that need a high amount of fertilizers. 
                        Seeds are sown in nursery beds and then transplanted to the main field. It has shown tremendous success for the high yielding varieties.</li>

                    Harvesting Rice
                </h3>
                <p>One of the essential factors in rice cultivation is in-time rice harvesting otherwise the grains would shed.
                     Irrigation of the field is completely stopped about a week before harvesting. This dehydration process helps 
                     in grain ripening. It also hastens maturity. In case of early and medium maturing varieties, harvesting should be 
                     carried out 25- 30 days after flowering. The late maturing varieties are harvested 40 days after flowering.
                      They are generally harvested when the moisture content is about 25%. Post harvesting, drying is carried out gradually under shade.</p>
