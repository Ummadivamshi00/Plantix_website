            <h3>Introduction of Barley: –</h3>
            <p>– Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is popularly known as “Jau” in Hindi and one of
                the most important cereal grain crops after rice, wheat & maize. In India, this crop is cultivated as a
                summer crop in temperate regions & as a winter crop in tropical regions. Barley is a short growing
                season crop and has good drought tolerant. In olden days, Barley was mainly used as livestock feed
                and currently it is one of the grains used daily in human consumption (barley malt).Barley also play
                major role in industrial consumption. Coarse cereals are made out of this along with other cereal crops
                like oats, pearl millet (bajra), finger millet (Ragi), corn/maize, sorghum (Jowar). Generally, Barley is
                cultivated as a rabi season crop in India and sowing being undertaken from Oct to Dec & harvesting
                from Mar to May.

                <h3>Barley Major Production States in India:– </h3><p>The major production states of Barley in India are
                Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, West Bengal, Jammu & Kashmir, Some
                regions in Bihar, Uttaranchal and Himachal Pradesh.</p> <hr>
                <h3>Barley Local Names in India:- </h3><p>Barley (English), Jau (Hindi), Barley (Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam), Satu
                (Marathi), Baarli Arisi (Tamil), Joba (Bengali),Sattu (Punjabi).</p> <hr>
                <h3>Climate Requirement for Barley Cultivation:</h3>
                <p>Barley can be grown as summer crop as well as winter
                    crop. This crop is mainly cultivated as Rabi season crop in India. This crop requires temperature of
                    12°C to 16°C at growing stage and about 30°C to 32°C at maturity. This crop is very sensitive to frost at
                    any stage of its growth. This crop yield is highly impacted by incidence of frost at flowering stage.
                    Barley has very good tolerance to drought conditions.
                    </p> <hr>
                <h3>Soil Requirement for Barley Cultivation:</h3>
                <p>Barley crop can be grown on wide range of soils including
                    saline, sodic & lighter soils. However, this crop thrives best in sandy to moderately heavy loam soils
                    having neutral to saline reaction and medium fertility. Acidic soils are not suitable for Barley
                    cultivation</p> <hr>
                <h3>Land Preparation, Seed Rate, Treatment and Sowing in Barley Cultivation:</h3>
                <p>– Land should be
                    prepared to fine tilth stage and weed free by giving 2 to 3 ploughing with cultivator followed by
                    planking. To prevent from soil borne diseases and pest like Termite, Ants and other insects, seed
                    treatment should be carried. Seed treatment is advisable in barley cultivation to prevent smut diseases
                    and termites. Treat seeds with Bavistin @ 2 gm per Kg seed for the treatment of Loose Smut disease
                    where as in covered Smut disease, seeds should be treated with Vitavax @ 2.5 gm per Kg. Seeds
                    should be treated with 250 ml Formathion (25 EC) in 5 liter of water for 100 Kg seed to prevent the
                    termites. The best method of sowing in Barley cultivation is with a seed drill or dropping seeds with a
                    Chonga attached to a desi plough. Line sowing with seed drill is more effective. The following shows
                    seed rate and spacing in Barley cultivation.</p> <hr>

                    <h3>Crop Rotation in Barley Cultivation:- </h3><p>Crop rotation is beneficial in Barley cultivation. The following
                        are the preferred combinations.
                        Maize-Barley, Bajra-Barley, Rice-Barley, Sorghum-Barley, Pigeon pea-Barley, Sugarcane-Barley, BajraBarley, Cotton-Barley, Sesame-Barley and Rice-Barley
                    </p> <hr>
                    <h3>Irrigation in Barley Cultivation:-</h3><p> 2 to 3 irrigations are enough in Barley cultivation for optimum yield.
                        First irrigation should be given at crown root initiation, 25 to 30 days after sowing.
                        Second irrigation should be given at panicle emergence, 65-75 days after sowing.</p>
                    <p><b>Weed Control and Intercultural Operations in Barley Cultivation:- </b>Broad leaf and Narrow leaf are
                        the main weeds found in Barley cultivation. Appropriate weed sides should be used to control these.<br>
                        <b>Broad Leaf=> </b>625 gramsof 2,4-D (Na-Salt 80%) and 625 grams of 2,4-D (Easter 38%) should be
                        mixed in 250 liters of water separately and applied per hectare after a month of sowing.<br>
                        <b>Narrow leaf=> </b>1250 grams of Isoproturan 75 % WPshould be mixed in 250 liters of water and
                        applied in 1 ha land after a month of sowing.
                        </p> <hr>
                    <h3>Pests and Diseases in Barley Cultivation:- </h3><p>Covered smut, Loose smut, Leaf rust, Stem rust, Stripe
                        rust, Powdery mildew, Net blotch, Spot blotch, Stripe, Root rot and foot rot, mosaic and Sclerotial
                        disease are the diseases and pests found in Barley cultivation. Some of them can be prevented from
                        seed treatment, however, contact local agriculture/horticulture department for appropriate control
                        measures.</p> <hr>
                    <h3>Harvesting in Barley Cultivation:- </h3>
                    <p> Usually, Barley crop will be ready for harvesting by end of the
                        March to mid of April. Barley should be harvested in right time to prevent from over ripening to avoid
                        breaking of spikes. Barley grain has a property of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere so the
                        crop should be stored in dry place. Machine harvesting is preferred in Barley farming.
                        </p> <hr>
                    <h3>Yield in Barley Cultivation:</h3>
                    <p>Yield of the crop depends on the cultivar/variety, farm management
                        practices and weather conditions. An average yield of 18 to 20 quintals/acre can be expected.</p>
